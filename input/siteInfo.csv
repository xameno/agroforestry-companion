1,"","In Portugal, the main agroforestry system is a traditional system called Montado. It is characterized by low density trees combined with agriculture or pastoral activities. The main tree species encountered in the Montado are cork oak (Quercus suber L) and/or holm oak (Quercus rotundifolia L). Mixed stands with a combination of these species are also common. Cork oak based Montado areas are included in the Portuguese National Forest Inventory (NFI) as part of the cork oak and holm oak forest area, which occupies 736,775 ha and 331,179 ha respectively (AFN, 2010). There are substantial variations in the management of the understorey ranging from forest systems (cork in cork oak systems) to agrosilvopastoral systems (cork, sweet acorns, animal and/or crop production together). The majority of the Montado area is in the south-east of Portugal, although there are some areas in the north of the country.

Agroforestry also exists in North and Central Portugal in the form of natural pastures where trees are included as hedges, borders or riparian forest lines (collectively known as ""Lameiros""), and there are considered to be about 41400 ha of low density stands of sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) called ""Soutos e castinçais"".","","","","","","Montado in Portugal - Agforward - en",NA,NA

These trees, traditionally built for field demarcation, are important for local fire wood consumption, animal fodder, soil protection from water or wind erosion (Pereira et al. 2004), and pasture improvement (Pereira et al. 2005). These areas, although characterized by deep and fertile soils, have been suffering abandonment as grazing is reduced in these regions (INE 2014). In turn, the abandonment of grazing rapidly changes the composition of the herbaceous stratus composition, increasing the presence of species with low pasture interest (Amaro 2009). In addition, the trees are frequently removed thereby decreasing biodiversity. It is difficult to assess the area of such systems due the lack of official inventory data.","Depth: Deep soils

30,"Centre and southern Portugal","Honey Locust (Gleditsia triacanthos) is leguminous tree, having a deep taproot 
growing down 3-6 m deep and few lateral roots that make it suitable for 
agroforestry systems. Furthermore, in young plants, stems bear very large, flat 
thorns and the young trees form very dense thorny thickets, providing defence to 
animal browsing, where coppice regrowth and pods are a valuable fodder. It begins 
bearing pods 3 years after planting and it can produce 20-75 kg pods/tree within 8 
years. However this system is underutilized. 
 
Gleditsia triacanthos by nature has small, sparse foliage and a long period of leaf 
retention. The root system develops from a central taproot that can extend 
downward to 3-6 m permitting the tree to absorb water and nutrients of great 
depths. Moreover, it usually has fewer lateral roots than many other potential 
agroforestry trees, which minimizes its competition with the companion crop.  
 
These characteristics makes honeylocust interesting for inclusion in agroforestry 
systems. It succeeds on most soils, so long as they are well drained and can grow on 
nutritionally poor soils This species likes long hot summers and may thus not 
produce well in maritime climates. Research findings (Dupraz and Newman 1997) 
show the potential of Gleditsia triacanthos as a fodder tree for ruminants. It is 
estimated that on a deep soil with high water resources, an orchard at 200 trees/ha 
may produce about 2 ton of pod dry matter at age 10 years (Dupraz and Newman 
1997). Trees show an alternate bearing pattern and some varieties are in opposite 
phases, making a mixture of clones necessary to achieve sustained yields.  
 
It is intolerant to shading, resistant to drought and highly resistant to flooding. 
Highly sensible to fire due to its thin bark.  
Young leaves of Gleditsia have a forage value near the values of Lucerne 
In central and southern Portugal it can be found along streets and roads and also in

They include high-stem and medium stem trees associated with an herbaceous stratum on the ground. Their purpose was traditionally to delimitate property boundaries, to provide protection for livestock (shelter) and crops (windbreaks), and to produce adequate resources of firewood and timber. They are associated with mixed livestock-cropping farming systems. Traditional hedgerows in Brittany are characterized by a diversity of boundary structures (e.g. with or without bank), of management regimes by farmers, and of vegetation structures and composition (Baudry and Jouin 2003). The recognition of the environmental value of hedgerows (see, for instance, Baudry et al. 2000) has led to the implementation of several programs of hedgerow plantations throughout Brittany. Amongst them, a few programs rely on innovative approaches, promoting adaptive design and management of hedgerows by farmers, as well as spatial connections between hedgerows on the farm.

Wood pastures and parklands are valued for their biodiversity including deer, 
butterflies, lichens, fungi, and saproxylic invertebrates such as spiders and 
beetles (Maddock 2011; Fay 2004). A mosaic of grassland and woodland 
habitats can also encourage wild pollinators such as bees (Mallinger et al. 
2016). Wood pastures can favour birds such as woodpeckers and bats which 
can roost in crevices and hollows. Long established closed herds of deer and 
livestock are often associated with wood pastures (Maddock 2011).

Hence, the farmers are not allowed to harvest the old trees for their biomass without special permission. As a consequence, the hedges are not maintained and their rejuvenation is further hindered by the presence of cattle. In addition to grazing pressure, trampling, tree aging and diseases significantly reduced natural rejuvenation.","Gleysol","Biomass for heating and cooling . Meat, milk.

In the forest area of the nature conservation zone in the Spreewald reserve the average timber use for the period 2000-2010 was 2.9 and 3.3 m3 ha-1 yr-1 for the regions of Oberspreewald and Unterspreewald, respectively (MLUL 2012). The average yield of the grassland in Spreewald was estimated between 2 and 6 Mg DM ha-1 yr-1 which is in accordance with extensively managed grasslands (LUGV 2011). Regulating services The trees increase carbon storage, regulate the water balance and water quality. In the forest area of the nature conservation zone in Spreewald Reserve the average growth increment for the period 2000 to 2010 was 6.3 
and 6.7 m3 ha-1 yr-1 for the regions of Oberspreewald and Unterspreewald, 
respectively (MLUL 2012). Compared with the average timber use of 2.9 and 
3.3 m3 ha-1yr-1 in these regions, the trees are storing a significant amount of 
carbon in their biomass (MLUL 2012).  
 
High Nature and Cultural Value (HNCV) grasslands are related with improving 
water quality as leaching of nitrate is reduced under the extensive 
management. The average reduction for extensively managed grassland in 
Germany is between 0 and 20 kg N ha-1 when compared to intensively 
managed grassland and between 30 and 70 kg N ha-1 when compared to 
agricultural land (Osterburg et al. 2007). The average costs of preventing N 
leaching for the former were estimated at 100€ ha-1 and for the latter at 400€ 
ha-1 (Matzdorf et al. 2010).  
Habitat services and 
biodiversity 
The system provides habitats for rare species and assessing the development 
of biodiversity can be used to optimize the management of the system. 
Within the Environmental Monitoring Program established in 1998 data 
regarding relevant parameters is collected to assess soil, water, flora and 
fauna for different ecosystem types in the Spreewald reserve, e.g. forests, 
moor, grassland and agricultural land (Luthardt et al. 2007).  
 
The development of earthworm fauna in the forest ecosystem between 2000 
and 2003 was related to the development of vegetation and weather 
fluctuations (Jenssen and Hofmann 2004). During an extreme drought period 
in 2003, a strong reduction in the abundance and biomass of earthworms was 
measured in the monitoring areas affected by drought. The earthworm 
abundance was reduced from 3.9 million ha-1 to 0.4 million ha-1 in a plot with 
bird cherry-European ash and from 2.8 million ha-1 to 0.6 million ha-1 in a plot 
with nettle and black alder. The vegetation patterns of black alder stands 
were related to the hydrological conditions of the groundwater table, with 
flooding during winter and the drying of the top soil in summer. 
 
Tree vitality, recently investigated at selected locations in Spreewald, was also 
found to follow the pattern of flooding events (Birnstengel 2015). Black alder 
stand damage on an area basis was observed in a location flooded for 5 to 12 
weeks, whereas in locations flooded for 3 to 6 weeks trees were partly 
damaged. The damage could be mostly related to the variation in relief and 
the occurrence of diseases, such as Phytophthora alni. A clear link between 
structural diversity or tree species and tree damage could not be established.  
 
The Spreewald grasslands are rich in biodiversity including Red List species, 
for example Caltha palustris, Ranunculus auricomus agg., Stellaria palustris, 
Carex vesicaria, Lychnis flos-cuculi (LUGV 2011). The different species found 
within a monitoring plot varied between 3 and 9, while the total number of 
species varied between 6 and 32. The development of species was related to 
the intensity of use as different species have different requirements, but no 
clear trend regarding the influence of intensity, hydrology and soil conditions 
was found. 
 
Considering implementation of measures from the national biodiversity 
strategy, the willingness to pay to preserve biodiversity of HNCV grasslands in Germany amounted to approximately 10€ per month (Matzdorf et al. 2010). The system has a high aesthetic and cultural value and is of importance for 
tourism. The region of Spreewald is important tourist area with about 2 to 2.2 
million visitors between May and September each year (Grossmann 2011). 
With the decline in mining activities in the Lusatian region, water has become 
a contested resource and concerns were raised that the reduced water 
quantity could negatively affect the boat tourism which is important for the 
Spreewald region. The recreational value of the Spreewald wetland for 
boating trip tourism was quantified by Grossmann (2011) by using a travel 
cost method. For a one day trip the consumer surplus was estimated at 19€ 
and for a 3 day trip at 33€. A reduced water quantity would significantly affect 
the economic value of the area as recreational point considering the high 
number of tourists. ","","WP2_D_Spreewald_system_description.pdf",NA,NA

59," southern Transylvania, Central Romania.","Wood-pastures from this region emerged from woodland grazing which was common up to the nineteenth century. Typically these systems are pastures with scattered trees. The tree density on these pastures is ca 4-7/ha and it shows a decreasing tendency.","Brown forest soils and podzolic clay, argilo-aluvial podzolic soils with clay and alluvial regosoils. These soil types are typical for oak forests","Current use of the trees: largely as shadow for livestock and sporadically for fruits. For example we found that some persons still collect acorn from wood pastures as food supply for sheep. This activity is very rare nowadays and in many villages it disappeared. Historically the tree products regularly used by the local communities include: acorns for pigs, tree hay to complement the shortage of grass hay in extreme hot summers, pear and apple as feed for livestock as well as for brandy (a locally made alcoholic drink). Much of these tree products have been abandoned in the past half century. Several villages for example do not produce any brandy (i.e. they completely abandoned the goods produced by pear trees) and these coincides with the removal of several hundreds of pear trees from pastures. Overall, the abandonment of the traditional tree products from Transylvanian wood-pastures and the lack of any clear initiative to revive the value of trees for the local community suggest a narrowing and more specialized valuation and use of these systems. The economic valuation of the current wood pasture systems is now largely based on the herbaceous layer while the trees are in sharp decline. The CAP and national level policies also discourage the use of tree related products. Lamb and sheep (meat and milk) ","","Regulating services Services recognized by local stakeholders:  Shade for livestock (primary role, recognized by the great majority of stakeholders)  Buffering the grassland against wind and dryness (recognized by some stakeholders)  Nutrient cycling (the hollowing, dried trees release minerals) is also recognized by few farmers.  Controlling soil erosion (recognized by few stakeholders, also recognized in historical records) Regulating services are indicated from a scientific perspective but there are no experiments on this aspect from Transylvania. In conclusion, the assessment of ecosystem service type has largely been determined from local stakeholders; some of these have experience-based knowledge with the system. Habitat services and biodiversity Services recognized by stakeholders: only very few stakeholders mentioned about the natural value of scattered and especially old trees. These stakeholders are not typical for the farmer community (e.g. they have formal education and access to internet and international TV channels, and “love nature”). Scientific research highlighted the exceptional biodiversity value of wood pastures. Biodiversity potential: in an ancient oak wood-pasture from Romania of 133 hectares, there were 476 species of vascular plants, 121 species of macromycetes, 281 species of Lepidoptera, 40 species of xylophagous beetles, 27 species of nesting birds, and 38 species of mammals (Hartel et al. 2013). Wood-pastures contain more bird species and functional groups than high forests and open pastures (Hartel et al. 2014). More recent surveys carried out in a moderately intensively grazed wood-pasture (with 1.1 livestock units (LU) per hectare) revealed exceptionally diverse spider communities in such systems, with 140 species and four new species of spiders for Romania (Gallé, Szpisjak, Urák and Hartel manuscript in preparation). These findings reveal the outstanding, yet under studied biodiversity values of the traditional wood-pastures of Eastern Europe. Large, old trees: research carried out in Transylvania showed that the largest old trees from a large region are concentrated in wood-pasture systems and not in high forests. The density of large, old oaks in 25 wood-pastures ranged between 0.0085 – 1.25 trees ha-1 (Moga et al. 2016). Wetlands and wood-pastures: research showed that wood-pastures grazed with buffalo and cattle contain significantly more small wetlands than those grazed by sheep. The reason of this is that the buffalo and cattle create those disturbances which removes native vegetation, allowing the maintenance of small wetlands. By contrast, sheep avoid wet areas resulting in vegetation enrichment in wetlands. The yellow bellied toad is highly abundant in buffalo grazed wood-pastures while less abundant in sheep grazed systems (Hartel and von Wehrden 2013). Cultural services 
When wood-pastures were communally managed in this region, they had the 
following important cultural services: 
 Bringing together the local community each year e.g. for pasture 
clearance and maintenance activities. Every member of the community 
had an obligation to take part in these activities depending on their 
number and types of livestock. These activities are still remembered by 
old persons in the community. These activities could serve as good 
community organization model around pasture management. 
 Sets of rules existed regarding the use of the collapsed/fallen large old 
trees in the wood-pastures. These trees were used strictly on the 
community benefits, e.g. by local carpenters.  
 Ancient wood-pastures were arenas for cultural gatherings. We are aware 
about such gatherings in Sighisoara, Medias, Rupea and Sibiu towns. Most 
of these gatherings were cancelled in the communist regime. Some new 
initiatives exist to revive these gatherings, e.g. the ‘Breite days’ 
(Sighisoara, Mihai Eminescu Trust). ","","WP2_RO_Wood_pasture_system_description.pdf",NA,NA

Paddocks are normally used for two years (in the case of sows) and cultivated 
for one or two, before pigs return on same field. Fattening fields are used in 
different ways and with several rotation methods (pigs-crops) according to 
the number of months used per year, crops or cultivation techniques on 
pasture during winter months. Usually, fields are used for 2-3 years (for 8-9 
months each year) and cultivated with cereals for two years before returning 
with pigs. In a different system pigs stay in the field from May to November 
and crops (barley or mixed barley and peas) are cultivated for the other part 
of the year. This system require a specific type of soil (preferable sandy) and a 
good farming organization for seeding-harvesting crops in a short range of 
time. 
 
The stocking rate depends on production method (conventional or organic) 
and on specific vulnerability level area towards nitrates (maximum 170 kg of 
N ha-1 from manure per year). Common stocking densities for sows are 
between 7 and 10 per ha, whereas number of growing pigs vary from 13-17 
(organic) to 20-25 animals per ha (conventional, not in vulnerable areas). ","Varied","Trees are harvested to produce wood: first or second quality poplar,

in balls, late stage as grains or grazed by sows). Summer cereals are normally

Free range pig production using pasturage and tree-shrubs areas in low 
mountain valley (between 400-800 m asl) could utilize marginal or less 
productive meadows and prevent the abandon of agriculture activities in 
these areas (by offering different income source to farmers).  However more

The huts are placed directly on the ground and supplied with straw. The paddocks are usually moved to a new field each spring, often in a two year crop rotation - one year with barley with an under-sown grass-ley and one year with sows on pasture. The stipulated maximum stocking rate corresponds to an estimated excretion of 140 kg N in pigs manure per ha and year (equivalent to 280 kg N ha-1 every second year).

Instead of pastures with borders of hedgerows or wooded banks, the tree rows were planted within the pasture. To study the potential of short rotation coppice for fodder purposes, fast growing tree species were selected, which were planted in high densities in twin rows. As the particular pasture was very wet, which was problematic for grass yields and grazing, species were selected that are able to grow in wet conditions.

67,"throughout the UK","Silvopastoral systems that cultivate trees specifically for fodder include fodder bank systems, where trees and shrubs are planted at high densities and pruned regularly to maximize productivity, and alley pasture systems which further integrate livestock and tree production with rows of trees and shrubs separated by alleys of pasture, with perceived benefits to enhanced nutrient cycling and improved animal welfare (Ibrahim et al. 2005). In modern silvopastoral systems that seek to maximize resource efficiency, there is growing interest in exploiting tree fodder as an extra resource from trees planted for other purposes such as resource protection. For example, farmers in New Zealand have been exploring the value of willows and poplars planted for soil conservation to provide emergency feed during severe summer droughts (Anon. 1996). The value of tree fodder as a feed resource to buffer forage shortages is also increasingly appreciated in areas of seasonal droughts (Andrews 1998; Lefroy et al. 1992; Moore et al. 2003; Papanastasis et al. 2008b).

An experimental agroforestry system was setup and planted in 1988, to explore the production benefits and disbenefits of integrating trees within a livestock farming system. The site was part of the UK Silvopastoral National Network Experiment.
Three tree species were selected (Scots Pine, Hybrid Larch and Sycamore) and planted at a range of different densities. This allowed comparison of these differences on a range of factors including tree growth, grass production and livestock output. The site has been grazed by sheep and, more recently, also by suckler cattle.
The original experiment ended in 2000, but the majority of agroforestry plots were retained and maintained since then (some low density hybrid larch plots were felled in 1995), and have continued to provide a valuable platform for a range of scientific research. Currently some of the plots are schedule for thinning and some others for felling and restocking.
Building on lessons learned from these original research plots, as well as from agroforestry studies elsewhere, a new design of silvopastoral agroforestry has been planted in 2024 adjacent to the original plots. This integrates oak, a range of other amenity trees and grazing pasture.","","(Intended) use of trees:
